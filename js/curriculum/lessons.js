When you press "Init" then "Start" on the Driver Station, you\'re telling the Control Hub: "Go!"<br><br>Every FTC match has two phases: <strong>Autonomous</strong> (30 seconds, robot runs entirely on pre-written code, no gamepads) and <strong>TeleOp</strong> (2 minutes, drivers control the robot with gamepads).
