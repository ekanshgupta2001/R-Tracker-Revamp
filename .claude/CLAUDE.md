# CLAUDE.md — R-Tracker v2 (Zero-Data Rebuild)

You are working on the `v2` branch of R-Tracker. Your job is to convert the v1 app, step by step, into a
version that handles **no student data outside the student's own browser**. Read `PROJECT.md` for what
we're building and `PLAN.md` for the order of work. Do not skip phases in `PLAN.md`; each one ends with
a verification gate that must pass before you continue.

The frozen v1 reference lives at the git tag `v1-final` (and on `main` until v2 is merged). Read it with
`git show v1-final:<path>`; **never commit to `main` or move the tag.**

## Project overview

R-Tracker is a browser-based FTC (FIRST Tech Challenge) training platform for Team 25702 Rundle Robotics
Castle: 2D/3D driver-practice simulator, autonomous path planner, match strategy planner, a programming
curriculum with theory and code checkpoints, and a progress report. v1 used Firebase Auth + Firestore and
the Gemini API. v2 is the same product as a **static site**: no accounts, no database, no AI API, no
server. Progress lives in the browser tab (`sessionStorage`) and in a `.json` file the student exports.

- **Live (v1):** https://r-tracker.netlify.app — keeps deploying from `main` until v2 is merged.
- **GitHub:** github.com/ekanshgupta2001/R-Tracker

## Your three jobs

1. **Revitalize** — strip out the parts that no longer apply (Firebase Auth, Firestore, Cloud/Netlify
   Functions, Gemini) and rebuild the affected features (progress, report, theory grading, code checks)
   on a client-only architecture. Keep everything that already works and doesn't touch data (Three.js
   teleop practice, path planner, strategy planner, curriculum content, UI/animations).
2. **Debug** — every phase leaves the app in a runnable state. A half-migrated feature is hidden behind a
   flag or removed from navigation, never shipped broken. Playwright tests are updated alongside the
   code, not after.
3. **Audit** — before marking any phase complete, prove that no student data can be transmitted,
   persisted server-side, or displayed to anyone other than the student who produced it. Proof means
   grep results and a passing test, not a sentence saying "I checked."

## Hard constraints (never violate, never ask for exceptions)

- **No network requests carrying user-generated content.** No `fetch`/`XMLHttpRequest`/WebSocket calls
  that send anything a student typed, scored, or did. The only network activity is same-origin GETs of
  static files. Cross-origin requests are blocked by the Content-Security-Policy in `netlify.toml`, the
  `<meta http-equiv>` copy on every page, and `tests/serve.js`.
- **No authentication of any kind.** No Firebase Auth, no OAuth, no email/password, no "enter your name"
  that is stored anywhere but the local state / export file.
- **No server-side storage.** No Firestore, no Realtime DB, no Supabase, no analytics, no error reporting
  services, no leaderboards that leave the device.
- **No external AI APIs.** No Gemini, no OpenAI, no Anthropic, nothing. Grading and reports are
  deterministic client-side logic (see `PROJECT.md`).
- **No localStorage for student data.** The school rejected localStorage. Student state goes through
  `RTStore` (sessionStorage backend, swappable to memory). The only localStorage key allowed is
  `rt-theme` (UI preference). The only other browser storage keys are `rt-state`, `rt-stl-model`, and
  `rt-nav` in sessionStorage — all documented in `AUDIT.md`.
- **No third-party scripts loaded at runtime.** Three.js and fonts are vendored under `vendor/` and
  `assets/fonts/`. Before adding any dependency, confirm it makes zero outbound requests at runtime;
  vendor it, read it, record its hash and license in `vendor/README.md` and `AUDIT.md`.
- **Never execute student code.** The code checker is regex/string matching only: no `eval`,
  `new Function`, workers, iframes, or uploads.

## Definition of "student data" for this project

Treat all of the following as student data — anything in this list must only ever exist in the
student's browser (memory, sessionStorage) or in a file the student explicitly exports:

- identity: name, email, team name, team number, any ID that could map back to a person
- activity: practice runs, driver stats, times, scores, streaks, attempts
- answers: theory answers, code submissions, reflections, quiz responses
- derived: BKT mastery estimates, reports, rankings, anything computed from the above
- device/session: timestamps of use, IP, user agent — do not collect even if "harmless"

If you are unsure whether something is student data, it is.

## Verification gates (run at the end of every phase)

```bash
# 1. No banned services referenced anywhere in the codebase (quote the globs — zsh expands them otherwise)
grep -rniE "firebase|firestore|gemini|generativelanguage|googleapis|cloudfunctions|onAuthStateChanged|signIn|apiKey" \
  --include='*.js' --include='*.html' --include='*.json' --include='*.toml' --include='*.css' . \
  | grep -v node_modules | grep -v '^./vendor/'

# 2. No outbound calls in application code (review every hit by hand; each must be annotated in AUDIT.md)
grep -rnE "fetch\(|XMLHttpRequest|WebSocket|navigator\.sendBeacon|new Image\(" \
  --include='*.js' . | grep -v node_modules | grep -v '^./vendor/'

# 3. No leftovers from v1's auth/Firestore layer
grep -rnE "rtUser|rtDb|rtAuth|initAuth|serverTimestamp|netlify/functions|rtUserRole|rtUserTeamId" \
  --include='*.js' --include='*.html' . | grep -v node_modules

# 4. No student-code execution
grep -rnE "\beval\(|new Function|new Worker|importScripts" --include='*.js' --include='*.html' . \
  | grep -v node_modules | grep -v '^./vendor/'

# 5. Tests (self-contained: playwright.config.js starts tests/serve.js)
npm test
npm run test:unit
```

Gate 1 must return nothing. Gate 2 hits must each be annotated in `AUDIT.md` with why they are safe
(e.g. "loads the local field image from `assets/`"). `tests/network-audit.spec.js` intercepts all
network requests during a full student session and asserts every one is a same-origin GET with no
query string and no body.

## Tech stack (v2)

- **Frontend:** Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript. No framework, no bundler, no build step.
- **Scripts:** plain `<script src>` files that expose globals from IIFEs (`window.RTStore`,
  `window.renderLessons`, …). **Not** ES modules — the whole codebase uses classic scripts and `var`.
- **3D:** Three.js r128 vendored at `vendor/three/`.
- **State:** `js/schema.js` (`RTSchema`: shape, versions, migration, import validation) and
  `js/store.js` (`RTStore`: load/get/update/save/clear/export/import; backends: sessionStorage, memory).
- **Grading:** `js/grader.js` (rubric grader for theory), `js/code-check.js` (structural code checker),
  `js/bkt.js` (Bayesian Knowledge Tracing), `js/report.js` + `js/report-templates.js` + `js/charts.js`.
- **Driver rating:** `js/level-table.js` (par time, difficulty weight and focus per level) and
  `js/driver-rating.js` (pure functions: run score, windowed difficulty-weighted rating, grade).
- **Hosting:** any static host. `netlify.toml` has no build command and no functions.
- **Testing:** Playwright (`tests/*.spec.js`, chromium) + Node's built-in test runner
  (`tests/*.test.js`) for grader fixtures.

## Key conventions

### JavaScript
- Vanilla JS only. `var`/`function` declarations, IIFEs, globals on `window`. No frameworks, no build
  tools, no ES modules in page scripts (test files under `tests/` are ESM because `package.json` has
  `"type": "module"`).
- All state reads go through `RTStore.get()`; all writes through `RTStore.update(function (s) { … })`.
  Update functions must be trivial (assignments only) — there is no rollback if they throw.
- Timestamps are epoch milliseconds (`Date.now()`).
- **Every user-provided or imported string placed in `innerHTML` MUST be escaped** with `esc()`,
  `sanitizeHTML()`, or `escSidebar()`. Imported `.json` files are untrusted input.
- DOM manipulation via `document.createElement()` and `innerHTML`.

### CSS
- **"Summit Atmosphere" (every page).** A golden-hour summit sky — the baked raster
  `assets/summit-sky.webp`, painted by `#rt-atmosphere` in `css/global.css` at `z-index: -1` (every page
  has `<div id="rt-atmosphere" aria-hidden="true">` right after `#rt-overlay`) — sits behind liquid-glass
  surfaces. Gold `#e8b04b` is the action accent (`--gold`: primary buttons, active nav/tabs/tools,
  progress); burgundy `#800020` stays as the logo mark and as alpenglow in the horizon haze. Tokens live
  in `css/global.css`: surfaces `--glass` / `--glass-nav` / `--glass-tool` (three blurred levels) and
  `--glass-inset` (the flat fill for rows and cards nested inside a blurred surface); `--glass-border`,
  `--glass-highlight`, `--glass-shadow`; text `--text` / `--text-secondary` / `--text-muted` /
  `--text-faint`, and `--text-on-sky` + `--on-sky-shadow` for anything placed directly on the sky; accent
  text `--gold-text` / `--burgundy-text` (darkened on light glass); status `--good` / `--warn` / `--bad` /
  `--info` with `-soft` fills; `--medal-*`; `--chart-*`; `--code-bg` / `--code-text` (code surfaces are
  navy in both themes). Primitives: `.rt-glass*`, `.rt-sheet`, `.rt-button-primary|secondary|ghost`,
  `.rt-input`, `.rt-pill*`, `.rt-modal(-backdrop)`, `.rt-code`, `.rt-stat`, `.rt-card-icon`, `.rt-label`,
  `.is-good|warn|bad|info`. No glows, no gradient text, no emoji — icons are inline SVG from
  `window.RT_ICONS` (`js/sidebar.js`): static markup uses `<span class="rt-icon" data-rt-icon="save">`
  (hydrated on load), scripts use `rtIcon('save')`.
- **Blur budget.** `backdrop-filter` costs a re-blur on every frame of the theme crossfade, so a page
  blurs only its top-level sheets (sidebar, topbar, side panels), a bounded number of cards and one modal.
  Everything repeated inside them (list rows, level cards, quiz options, code lines) is a flat
  `--glass-inset` / `--glass-tool` fill. Nothing between `<body>` and a canvas gets `backdrop-filter` or
  `overflow: hidden` (the TeleOp 3D view walks those ancestors).
- **Theme.** `light` on `<html>` is light glass and is the default a student lands on; removing the class
  gives dark glass. The boot script in every page's `<head>` adds it unless `localStorage['rt-theme']`
  is `'dark'`. Every stylesheet spells the dark variant `html:not(.light)`, and the page stylesheets
  carry no theme blocks at all: they read tokens, and the tokens flip in `global.css`. **A new colour
  goes in as a token with both values, never as a hex in a page stylesheet.** Canvas-drawn colour (charts,
  the 3D scene) is read from the tokens with `getComputedStyle` and re-drawn on the `rt-themechange`
  event that `toggleTheme()` dispatches on `window`.
- Keep the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query support.
- Font: Inter, self-hosted via `css/fonts.css` (variable woff2 in `assets/fonts/`), with a system fallback.
  TeleOp readouts use `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums`; only code surfaces use a monospace stack.

### Storage (`RTStore`)
- One constant, `RT_STORAGE_BACKEND` in `js/store.js`, selects `'session'` or `'memory'`. Tests can
  override it by setting `window.__RT_BACKEND` before scripts run.
- `schema.js` is the single source of truth for what is stored. If a field is not in
  `createEmptyState()`, it is not stored. Bump `SCHEMA_VERSION` and add a migration when the shape changes.
- Export produces `rtracker-progress-YYYY-MM-DD.json`; import validates with `RTSchema.validateImport`
  and confirms before overwriting.
- Schema 3 (2026-09-22): path-planner waypoint headings are Pedro's convention (0 = +x,
  counter-clockwise); migration 3 maps older files' compass headings through `90 − h`.

### Path planner
- `js/pathplanner/codegen.js` emits a Pedro Pathing 3 class: `PoseFactory.degrees()`, one `Path`
  method per segment (`line()`/`curve()` + `.linear()`), `fullPath()` joining them; no `Follower`
  in the class. Headings are stored and drawn in Pedro's convention (`canvas.js`, `ui.js`); a node
  test (`tests/pathplanner-codegen.test.js`) pins the emitted text.

### Curriculum
- Phase 0: Java quiz (10 MC, 80% to pass, unlocks Phase 1). Phases 1–2: code lessons with MC checks.
  Phases 3–5: theory sections first (written answers, rubric-graded), then code sections. Advanced 1–2:
  reference modules. Capstone: project brief with rubric.
- Theory: each `written_answer` check carries a `rubric` (required concepts with accepted phrasings,
  disqualifiers, threshold, per-concept hints) or `graded: false` ("Reflection — share with your
  mentor"). Pass = `score >= 70`.
- Code: `checkCode(phaseId, code)` runs the per-phase rules in `js/curriculum/code-rules.js` and returns
  `{ status, passed, score, summary, strengths, issues, requirements_met, next_steps }`. Auto-verify
  needs `status === 'graded' && passed && score >= 75`. It is a structural check, and the UI says so.
- A `submitted` deliverable (submit for mentor review) unlocks the next phase but is never shown as
  "verified".
- Every graded check appends to `curriculum.attempts`; BKT reads only `graded: true` events.
- **Code lessons and the checker target Pedro Pathing 3 and Ivy** (Phase 4, Phase 5, Advanced 1,
  Capstone): `PoseFactory.degrees()` + `p.of(x, y, deg)`, `Paths.line/curve/path`, chained
  `.linear/.constant/.tangent`, `Constants.create(hardwareMap)`, `follower.pose().x()`, and for
  following/commands `Command.build()`, `Scheduler.reset()/execute()`, `sequential/parallel/race`,
  `instant/waitMs`, `.requiring()`, `PedroCommands.follow(follower, path)`. The docs document no
  non-Ivy way to follow a path, so Phase 4 teaches the three Ivy lines it needs. The Pedro 2 /
  FTCLib names (`pathBuilder`, `BezierLine`, `setLinearHeadingInterpolation`, `followPath`,
  `SubsystemBase`, `SequentialCommandGroup`, …) are flagged by the checker as legacy and guarded
  against in `tests/lessons-api.test.js`. Reference: `Docs-master/content/docs/{pathing,ivy}` (an
  untracked copy of pedropathing.com; the swerve pages there are stale 2.x content).

### TeleOp
- 2D canvas: 144x144 inch FTC field (BIOBUZZ 2026–27). The HIVE frame and the four FLOWERS are
  solid in both modes (`COLLISION_ZONES` in `js/teleop/robot.js`); hitting one at speed counts as a
  collision like a wall. 3D view: Three.js, replaces the 2D canvas in-place (same parent container).
  Input: Gamepad API + keyboard (WASD + arrows), listeners on `document`. 12 levels across 4 tiers
  with star ratings, all routed in the ring around the frame (a unit test checks the clearances).
- **Physics (`js/teleop/drive.js`) models a real 435 RPM mecanum drivetrain.** Defaults: 6.5 ft/s,
  strafe at 80% of forward, 380 °/s spin (190 °/s while driving flat out, because the wheel-power
  normalisation shares the motors), 20 ft/s² traction cap, 20 ft/s² BRAKE-mode braking, 0.2 s
  first-order motor lag, 80 ms latency; every number is derived in the file header. Wheel powers are
  normalised exactly as an FTC TeleOp does and the body velocity comes from those powers, so turning
  while driving slows the robot and a full-stick diagonal is ~35% slower. Velocity is integrated in
  the robot frame (`bot.vFwd/vStr`, co-rotating with the heading because rolling wheels do not slip
  sideways) and rotated to the field frame (`bot.actualVx/Vy`) for position and metrics. The slider defaults in
  `pages/teleop.html` are the source of truth (`cfgUpdate()` runs before the first frame) and must stay
  on their step grids; `RT_LEVEL_TABLE.DEFAULT_PHYSICS` must equal them. Par times come from
  `tools/estimate-pars.mjs` (an ideal full-stick driver through the real `updateBot`, × 1.2) and each
  level's `timeLimit` is 2 × par, so gold (≤ 50% of the limit) means par pace. Re-run the tool and
  update both `js/level-table.js` and the `LEVELS` limits in `js/teleop/levels.js` whenever the
  physics change; a unit test checks the two files agree.
- The driver coach is rule-based (`js/teleop/coach.js`), not an LLM. Reports persist to
  `driver.coachReports`.
- **Driver rating measures outcomes, not style.** Every level attempt appends a run record to
  `driver.runs` (`levelId, sessionId, completed, timeMs, pathAccuracy, collisions, atSpeedFraction,
  styleMetrics, physics, rated, timestamp`). `js/driver-rating.js` scores a run from time against par
  (`js/level-table.js`; par = 70, 1.5× par = 100, 0.5× par = 20), times `(pathAccuracy/100)^0.5`, minus
  5 per wall hit; a failed run is 0. The Overall Rating is the difficulty-weighted mean of each level's
  best 3 run scores over the last 5 sessions (`window.RT_RATING_SESSIONS` overrides), over levels with
  at least one completed run. Grades: S 95, A 85, B 75, C 65, D 50. Every run stores the physics it
  was driven at; a run is rated only if that matches `RT_LEVEL_TABLE.DEFAULT_PHYSICS` at rating time,
  so runs at moved sliders, or from an older physics model, stay stored but drop out of the rating.
  Par times are `simulated` (see the physics bullet below); replace with measured times when possible.
- **Style metrics are diagnostics.** Smoothness, stability, strafe, turn precision and recovery are
  sampled only at ≥ 60% of max speed and weighted by speed/max (`js/teleop/metrics.js`). Under 20% of
  moving time at speed they read "insufficient data" (`null` in `driver.stats`). Turn precision is
  overshoot: degrees the driver corrects back within 1.2 s of releasing a ≥ 60% turn, capped at the
  coast (0° → 100, 30°+ → 0). They appear under "Why" on the Report Card and never feed the rating.
  Wall hits are detected in `metrics.js` from the boundary clamp (impact ≥ 1.5 ft/s, once per contact,
  excused within reach of a checkpoint). `drive.js`, `robot.js`, `input.js`, `view3d.js` and the level
  paths were not changed for this.

## Testing
- `npm test` runs Playwright; `playwright.config.js` starts `tests/serve.js` on `http://127.0.0.1:5501` (its own port, so VS Code Live Server on 5500 never interferes).
  `npm run serve` starts the same server for manual use. `npm run test:unit` runs fixture tests.
- Tests navigate with `page.goto`, never by clicking sidebar links (the page-transition script delays
  navigation). Wait on app globals with `waitForFunction`, never on `networkidle`.

## Working style
- Small, reviewable diffs. One phase per branch/commit set, tagged on completion (`v2-phase-N`).
- When you remove a feature, remove its navigation entry, its page, its tests, and its CSS. No dead
  links, no orphan files.
- When something in the old codebase is unclear, read `git show v1-final:<path>`. The full history of
  how it works is in Ekansh's head and the old chat logs, not in comments — ask before guessing at intent.
- Update `AUDIT.md` as part of every phase, not at the end.
- Do not "improve" features outside the current phase's scope. Log ideas in `PLAN.md` under *Deferred*.

## Common gotchas
- The page-transition script intercepts all `<a>` clicks — new navigation must use `<a href>` tags; it
  skips links with a `download` attribute or a `blob:` href (used by Export).
- `store.js` and `schema.js` are loaded non-deferred in `<head>` so every later script can call
  `RTStore.get()` synchronously. Keep that order.
- The 3D view uses `overflow: visible` on canvas ancestors — don't add `overflow: hidden` to parents.
- `sessionStorage` (≈5 MB) is shared by `rt-state` and the STL cache; `RTStore.save()` has a quota
  fallback chain. Don't add large blobs to state.
- `beforeunload` prompts only when state is dirty **and** `rt-nav` is not set (in-app navigation sets it).

## What "done" looks like

A static site that can be deployed to any static host, that a school IT admin can verify in ten minutes
by opening DevTools → Network, using the app for a full session, and seeing zero requests that contain
student input. Everything a student does lives in their browser tab or in a `.json` file they chose to
download.
